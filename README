Installation:

Just for avoiding a mess!

   mkdir ~/mydotvim ; cd ~/mydotvim
   git clone git://github.com/ntkog/mydotvim.git .

Now, only creating some symlinks, you can have several vim stacks
Just remember, if you want to use any of them, make sure .vim and .vimrc
points to vim stack you want to use

Create symlinks:
 
   ln -s ~/mydotvim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
   ln -s ~/mydotvim/ ~/.vim

Thanks a lot to all that people who wrote and share these excellent tools,
